          <h3>Good and Evil, Fact or Fancy? A Philosophical Analysis</h3>
         <h2>Dr. Howard Resnick </h2>




 <p>"Civilization itself rests on metaphysics… to say ‘you should not endanger others’ cannot be proven by science.” With this claim, H.D. Goswami (Dr. Howard Resnick) asks whether good and evil are facts or merely “fancy”—and presses a harder point: if values are real, what grounds them? Beginning with Aristotle’s “first philosophy,” Resnick argues that every “you should / must not” is already metaphysical, then tests modern attempts to keep morality without God—physicalism, compatibilism, and social-contract appeals—against that standard.

          <h3>The Dilemma Paradigm</h3>
          
         <p> “An actual dilemma is a situation where two or more values… come into conflict.” In his Summer Discovery Series talk, Robert Campagnola describes dilemmas as jolts of punctuated equilibrium—times when life refuses simple solutions and demands we choose which of our deepest values to honor. Such choices can feel terrifying, he admits: “When you actually step your foot into this mess and resolve it by your choice, it’s a scary, unknown future… but one thing you do know is you feel damn good about making it.” His reflections show why dilemmas are not setbacks to avoid but turning points that define who we are.

          <h3>Inductive vs. Deductive Reasoning: A Vedic Perspective</h3>
          <h2>Dr. Vadim Tuneev</h2>
   <p>In a world where scientific theories rise and fall with each new discovery, Bhakti Vijnana Goswami dares to ask: what if our very methodology of knowing is flawed? Drawing on his dual training as a molecular biologist and a scholar of the Bhāgavatam, he contrasts the inductive reasoning of modern science—fragmented, probabilistic, and ever-changing—with the deductive reasoning of the Bhāgavata tradition, which begins with fundamental principles and builds a coherent, holistic understanding of reality.
Far from blind faith, this deductive method is presented as a rigorous science: one that integrates complexity rather than reducing it, harmonizes knowledge across disciplines, and offers answers to the ultimate “why.” With clarity and authority, Goswami shows how Bhāgavata philosophy provides not just an alternative to materialist science, but a comprehensive paradigm capable of guiding discovery and restoring meaning to knowledge itself.
