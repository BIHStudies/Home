The easiest and most user-friendly way to handle this is to create a simple, single-column "article list" page.

You don't need a complex grid or multiple columns. Just a clean, scrolling page where each article is listed one after the other, like a blog. This is the easiest for you to build (just copy and paste) and the easiest for your users to read.

Here is the complete, ready-to-use code for your IHS.Articles.html page.

This code already includes your header, footer, and a simple structure for your articles.

          <h3>Michael Cremo — TSC Barcelona Report</h3>
          <p>Michael Cremo (Drutakarma Dasa) reflected on BIHS’s growing role at the Toward a Science of Consciousness conference. What began with posters has advanced to workshops and plenary talks.
