      <p>The Bhaktivedanta Institute for Higher Studies ("us," "we," or "our") operates the https://bihstudies.github.io/Home/ website (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

      <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
      
      <p>We do not directly collect any personally identifiable information from you when you visit our website. You can browse our site anonymously.</p>
      
      <p>If you choose to contact us via email or sign up for our newsletter via the provided third-party link, you will be voluntarily providing your information (such as your name and email address) to that service, not to this website directly.</p>

      <h3>Log Data & Analytics</h3>
      
      <p>Like most website operators, our web host (GitHub Pages) may collect standard, non-identifying information that your browser sends, such as your browser type, browser version, the pages you visit, and the time and date of your visit. This data is used for basic server administration and analytics and is not used to personally identify you.</p>
      
      <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
      
      <p>We do not use cookies to track you. However, some third-party services embedded on our site may use cookies.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Embedded Content:</strong> Pages on this site may include embedded content (e.g., YouTube videos). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites (like Google/YouTube) may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content.</p>

      <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
      
      <p>Our Service contains links to other sites that are not operated by us (such as our newsletter sign-up page or social media sites). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third-party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
      
      <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

      <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

      <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      
      <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>monicad [at] bihstudies.org</strong></p>
