      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        This 6-month training series is designed for educators, scholars, and thoughtful Bhakti practitioners who
        want to engage deeply with contemporary scientific and philosophical questions. Participants will explore
        core ideas in consciousness, metaphysics, cosmology, and ethics, and learn how to express these concepts
        with clarity and confidence in modern intellectual settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through study, dialogue, and guided skill-building, the course offers a reasoned and experiential approach
        to Bhagavata philosophy — one that encourages reflection, critical inquiry, meaningful communication, and
        practical application.

    <section class="course-section">
      <h3>Educational Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
        For anyone interested in exploring and communicating the philosophical foundations of the Bhāgavata
        tradition in contemporary scientific and intellectual contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach is grounded in clarity, intellectual honesty, and thoughtful dialogue. We encourage students
        to explore Bhāgavata perspectives through reasoned inquiry and to communicate them in ways that
        respectfully engage contemporary scientific and philosophical thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        The course is guided by scholars who bring specialized expertise in fields such as metaphysics,
        cosmology, consciousness studies, ethics, and the history of ideas — along with a deep, lived understanding
        of the Bhagavata tradition. This combination offers students both intellectual depth and authentic
        grounding in the philosophy itself.
