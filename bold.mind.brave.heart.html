      <h4>Certification &amp; Assessment</h4>
      <p>
        To support meaningful learning, each Unit concludes with a short reflective or practical assessment.
        A Unit Certificate is awarded upon completion of each Unit. Students who complete all five Units receive
        the Final Program Certificate, recognizing successful completion of the full six-month training.
      </p>

      <h4>Learning Outcomes & Enrollment Options</h4>
         <p>The learning outcomes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearer understanding of metaphysics, cosmology, consciousness, and ethics</li>
        <li>Improved reasoning, articulation, and communication skills</li>
        <li>Increased confidence engaging in scientific, philosophical, or interfaith conversations</li>
        <li>Deeper appreciation of the Bhagavata worldview and its contemporary relevance</li>
      </ul>
     
      <h4> A) Full Program Enrollment — $108 </h4>
     <p> This single program fee provides access to the entire six-month training, including all live Saturday sessions, Canvas modules, assignments, and assessments. Students also receive a Unit Certificate for each completed Unit and a Final Program Certificate upon successful completion of all requirements.
This option offers the greatest value, supporting a coherent journey that builds progressively from foundational metaphysics to applied consciousness studies. Students may participate synchronously or complete the material asynchronously through Canvas, depending on their schedule and learning needs.

</p>
      <h4>B) Per-Unit Enrollment — $30 per Unit</h4>
     <p>For those unable to commit to the full program at this time, individual Units may be taken separately for $30 each. Per-unit participation includes access to the Canvas environment, recordings for the selected Unit, and a Unit Certificate upon completion of its assessment.</p>
