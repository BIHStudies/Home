      <h3>Implementation &amp; Program Contribution</h3>

      <h4>Certification &amp; Assessment</h4>
      <p>
        To support meaningful learning, each Unit concludes with a short reflective or practical assessment.
        A Unit Certificate is awarded upon completion of each Unit. Students who complete all five Units receive
        the Final Program Certificate, recognizing successful completion of the full six-month training.
      </p>

      <h4>Program Contribution & Enrollment Options</h4>
      <p>
       Bold Minds, Brave Hearts is intended as a six-month guided training, and the full program offers the richest learning experience. Students who enroll in the complete course gain access to all five Units, the full Canvas learning environment, recordings of each session, course materials, and both Unit Certificates and the Final Program Certificate upon completion.
To make the training accessible to a wide range of sincere learners, BIHS offers two ways to participate:
      </p>
      <h2> A) Full Program Enrollment — $108 </h2>
     <p> This single program fee provides access to the entire six-month training, including all live Saturday sessions, Canvas modules, assignments, and assessments. Students also receive a Unit Certificate for each completed Unit and a Final Program Certificate upon successful completion of all requirements.
This option offers the greatest value, supporting a coherent journey that builds progressively from foundational metaphysics to applied consciousness studies. Students may participate synchronously or complete the material asynchronously through Canvas, depending on their schedule and learning needs.

</p>
      <h2>B) Per-Unit Enrollment — $30 per Unit
      <h4>Scholarship Support</h4>
      <p>
        For those unable to commit to the full program at this time, individual Units may be taken separately for $30 each. 
Per-unit participation includes access to the Canvas environment, recordings for the selected Unit, and a Unit Certificate upon completion of its assessment.
      </p>

        <h2>Registration</h2>

<p>As the first full-length BIHS training offered through our new Canvas platform, Bold Minds, Brave Hearts has a limited number of seats to ensure meaningful dialogue and personal engagement with the instructors. We encourage those who wish to participate to reserve their place soon, so the learning community can be formed with care and each student can be supported from the very beginning. </p>    
        <h4>Time Investment &amp; Expected Gains</h4>
      <p>
        The training meets once per week on Saturday for two hours, over two three-month period. Participants can
        expect to devote an additional 1–2 hours per week for reading, reflection, or short assignments.
      </p>
      <p>The learning outcomes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearer understanding of metaphysics, cosmology, consciousness, and ethics</li>
        <li>Improved reasoning, articulation, and communication skills</li>
        <li>Increased confidence engaging in scientific, philosophical, or interfaith conversations</li>
        <li>Deeper appreciation of the Bhagavata worldview and its contemporary relevance</li>
      </ul>
