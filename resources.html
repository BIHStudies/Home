        <div> <h4>Michael Cremo — TSC Barcelona Report</h4>
          <p>Michael Cremo (Drutakarma Dasa) reflected on BIHS’s growing role at the Toward a Science of Consciousness conference in Barcelona. What once began with posters has now advanced to workshops, plenary talks, and concurrent sessions. In his presentation Darwin and Consciousness, he argued that reducing awareness to brain activity is inadequate. Quoting physicist Federico Faggin, he noted that “theories of consciousness are like toothbrushes: everyone has one, and no one uses anyone else’s,” showing the field’s fragmentation and its openness to Vedic perspectives.</p>

        <div> <h4>   Ricardo Sousa Silvestre — Reflectionse</h4>
 <p>Ricardo Sousa Silvestre, Ph.D., shared impressions from philosophy sessions at TSC. He observed leading thinkers like Andrei Buckareff and Philip Goff discussing panpsychism and panentheism, supported by the Templeton Foundation. Reflecting on the conference, he noted: “With the decline of physicalism’s hegemony, the field is now exploring multiple directions… This presents a valuable opportunity to introduce a Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava account of consciousness—provided it is presented with the academic rigor required of any paradigm aspiring to challenge the dominant framework.” His reflections highlight both opportunity and responsibility for BIHS scholars.

    <p>In his review of Beyond Physicalism: Toward Reconciliation of Science and Spirituality, Dvija Govinda Das highlights how leading thinkers are seeking to move past strict materialist explanations of consciousness. His reflections emphasize the possibilities of a deeper dialogue between science and spirituality, opening pathways toward a more integrated understanding of human experience.

        <div> <h4> Virtue and Realism: Plural Epistemologies in Practice</h4>
       


<p>It’s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.” Starting from Mark Fisher’s diagnosis of capitalist realism, Charlotte shows how a value-neutral pose narrows our “epistemic horizon,” making alternatives seem naïve or “unreal.”
Her through-line is simple but demanding: practice virtue (Aristotle’s phronēsis), enact yogic virtues like satya (truthfulness as care for what is real), and rebuild our sense of the real through value-laden realism and anticipatory communities.

        <h3>God & Science</h3>
       <p> Synopsis:

<br> <br>In the world of modern science, traditional religion is often seen as a force of ignorance which attempts to impose outdated ideas on scientific truth. At the same time, many scientists see science giving rise to a materialistic doctrine of scientism that aims to eradicate the spiritual world view of religion.

This may seem to be an irreconcilable conflict. But there is another way to look at it. Science and religion can interact synergistically to generate new and interesting ideas.

God & Science is a collection of essays that examine the relationship between modern science and the Vaishnava tradition of India. Although little known in the West, the Vaishnava tradition is based on a monotheistic philosophy having much in common with Judeo-Christian thought. When brought into contact with modern science, Vaishnavism generates some of the same questions that arise from the confrontation of science and Christianity. At the same time, there are significant differences. These essays contain a smorgasbord of novel insights that provide new perspectives on the relation between science and religion.<a href="[LINK-TO-AMAZON-OR-STORE]" class="btn primary">Purchase Now</a>
