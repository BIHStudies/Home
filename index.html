         <h2> Our Mission</h2>
   <p class="lead">The Bhaktivedanta Institute for Higher Studies is an international center for research,
      education, and dialogue at the intersection of science, philosophy, and the Bhāgavata wisdom.
      Through courses, conferences, and publications, BIHS explores themes from consciousness to cosmology,
      from ethics to ecology, building bridges between rigorous scholarship and enduring wisdom.

          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            We envision a new era of inquiry in which science and philosophy converge to explore consciousness, investigating its role as both the subject and source of reality. Through this integration, research becomes self-transformative — leading not only to discoveries about the world, but to an awakening of wisdom, compassion, and ethical living.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>We engage the five great frontiers — Cosmogenesis, Biogenesis, Evolution, Consciousness, and Metaphysics. From cosmology to consciousness, our researchers are at the vanguard of a scientific revolution. We challenge the purely material worldview, exploring the profound idea that consciousness is not just a product of the brain, but is fundamental to reality itself. This is more than theory; it's a mission to translate philosophical wisdom into practical, world-changing efforts , fostering a science that is ethically grounded  and engaged with humanity's deepest purpose</p>
