<h2 style="color:#143d50;">BIHS Consciousness Studies — Questions & Answers</h2>

<p>This page answers the most common questions about participation, recordings, certificates, scheduling, and scholarships.</p>



<h3>1) Are sessions recorded? Can I participate on demand?</h3>
<p>
Yes. All live sessions are recorded and posted in <strong>Canvas</strong>. You can watch them on your own schedule, return to the lectures anytime, and participate through the discussion spaces.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://bihstudies.instructure.com/login/canvas">Canvas </a> access is available from <strong>January 12, 2026 through December 10, 2026</strong>. Within this time frame, you may take your time and learn at a pace that fits your life and service commitments.
</p>



<h3>2) I cannot attend Saturdays live. Is that a problem?</h3>
<p>
Not at all. Live attendance is encouraged but not required. Many participants follow the course through recordings due to time zones, work, or service.
</p>
<p>
Those who attend live can ask questions directly. Those who watch later can post questions in Canvas and receive faculty responses there.
</p>



<h3>3) How long is each session?</h3>
<p>
Each Saturday session is <strong>2 hours</strong>. If it begins at <strong>10:00 AM (EST)</strong>, it ends at <strong>12:00 PM (noon) (EST)</strong>.
</p>



<h3>4) How much homework is there each week?</h3>
<p>
The weekly workload is designed to be meaningful but manageable.
</p>
<p>A typical week includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Live session (2 hours) or watching the recording</li>
  <li>Light reading or short preparatory material (when assigned)</li>
  <li>Optional reflection or short knowledge check</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most participants spend about <strong>less than one additional hour per week</strong> outside the live class unless they choose to go deeper.
</p>



<h3>5) Is there an exam? Do I need to do quizzes?</h3>
<p>
The course includes short quizzes and reflections.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Certificate track:</strong> Quizzes and assignments are required for those who want to earn a <strong>BIHS Certificate of Completion</strong>.<br />
<strong>Audit (learning-only) track:</strong> You do not need to complete quizzes unless you want to check your understanding.
</p>
<p>
These assessments are meant to support learning, not create pressure.
</p>



<h3>6) Can I miss a session and still earn the certificate?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Because recordings are available, you can catch up by watching the recording in Canvas and completing the required activities for the certificate track.
</p>



<h3>7) Is the course self-paced or fixed pace?</h3>
<p>
The course follows a weekly schedule for the live sessions and group rhythm, but access is flexible because recordings and materials remain available in Canvas for the full access window.
</p>
<p>
In practice: <strong>structured course + flexible participation</strong>.
</p>



<h3>8) Can I join by unit? How many units are there?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Many participants join on a unit-by-unit basis.
</p>
<p>
There are <strong>five units</strong> in total, each taught by a different instructor. Each unit has its own focus and can be taken on its own while also contributing to the full program.
</p>



<h3>9) Is Unit 5 $30?</h3>
<p>
Yes. If the pricing model is <strong>$30 per unit</strong>, then Unit 5 costs <strong>$30</strong> for that unit. Additional discounts or scholarships may be available.
</p>



<h3>10) I have no income right now. Are scholarships available?</h3>
<p>
Yes. We have limited scholarship support available through donors and sponsors.
</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You submit a scholarship request (short form or email)</li>
  <li>We review requests as quickly as possible</li>
  <li>Scholarships may be full or partial depending on available sponsorships</li>
</ul>
<p>
Scholarships depend on donor-designated funds, but we do our best to support sincere participants whenever possible.
</p>



<h3>11) How are scholarships evaluated?</h3>
<p>Scholarships are typically based on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Financial need</li>
  <li>Sincere intention to participate</li>
  <li>Ability to engage respectfully and complete the course (especially for certificate track)</li>
</ul>
<p>
We keep the process simple and may ask a brief follow-up question if needed.
</p>



<h3>12) Is this course university-accredited?</h3>
<p>
This course is offered by the Bhaktivedanta Institute for Higher Studies and provides a <strong>BIHS Certificate of Completion</strong> for those who complete the requirements.
</p>
<p>
It is <strong>not</strong> a university-accredited course and does not provide official university credit.
</p>



<h3>13) Do I need a background in science, philosophy, or cosmology?</h3>
<p>
No. The course is designed to be accessible to participants from many backgrounds. Instructors explain concepts clearly, and Canvas discussions allow you to ask questions whenever something needs clarification.
</p>



<h3>14) Do I need to buy any books or materials?</h3>
<p>
No required purchases are needed. Any readings required for the course will be provided in Canvas or clearly listed in advance.
</p>



<h3>15) Can I use my phone instead of a computer?</h3>
<p>
Yes. You can download the <strong><a href="https://app.guidde.com/share/playbooks/xof4oFgVWFSWXZagL69GX5">Canvas Student App </a> </strong> on your phone or tablet to access recordings, materials, and discussions. A computer is recommended for longer writing, but it is not required.
</p>



<h3>16) Who is this course for?</h3>
<p>
This course is designed for devotees, congregational members, academics, and thoughtful seekers. It supports serious inquiry into consciousness while remaining accessible and respectful of different backgrounds.
